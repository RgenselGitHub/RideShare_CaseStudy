# Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study


## Introduction
For this case study I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at the fictional company Cyclistic. Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago, Illinois. Cyclistic has 5,824 bycicles that are locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. Pricing plans for the bikes are single-ride passes, full-ride passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase the single or full ride passes are considered casual riders and customers who purchase annual memberships are considered annual members. Lily Moreno, my manager and director of marketing at Cyclistic, wants to find out how to convert casual riders into annual members. Moreno has asked three questions in order to solve this. Moreno has assigned me to one of the three questions. The question is how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?  For this case study I will follow the six steps of the data analysis process that I have learned from Coursera's Google Data Analytics Certificate to solve the problem. The six steps are ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Lets get started!
